## 1. Sign the Contributor Agreement
We know, you love reviewing and signing legal documents in your spare time, but, our lawyers made us promise weâ€™d collect a signed contributor agreement before accepting Pull Requests. The process is quick and simple, we promise!

* For individuals, we have a docusign document ready to send you.
* For corporations, use this docusign document to get started.

To-Do.

## 3. Make a Pull Request

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge
into the project.

#### For new Contributors

If you never created a pull request before, welcome [Here is a great tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
on how to send one :)

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ProjectLighthouse/<repo-name>
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and
   features will not be accepted without tests. Run `npm test` to check that
   all tests pass after you've made changes. Look for a `Testing` section in
   the projectâ€™s README for more information.

5. If you added or changed a feature, make sure to document it accordingly in
   the `README.md` file.

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

#### For Members of the Lighthouse Contributors Team

1. Clone the repo and create a branch

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProjectLighthouse/<repo-name>
   cd <repo-name>
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

2. Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and
   features will not be accepted without tests. Run `npm test` to check that
   all tests pass after you've made changes. Look for a `Testing` section in
   the projectâ€™s README for more information.

3. If you added or changed a feature, make sure to document it accordingly in
   the `README.md` file.

4. Push your topic branch up to our repo

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

5. Open a Pull Request using your branch with a clear title and description.

Optionally, you can help us with these things. But donâ€™t worry if they are too
complicated, we can help you out and teach you as we go :)

1. Update your branch to the latest changes in the upstream master branch. You
   can do that locally with

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream master
   ```

   Afterwards force push your changes to your remote feature branch.

2. Once a pull request is good to go, you can tidy up your commit messages using
   Git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase).
   Please follow our commit message conventions shown below, as they are used by
   [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to
   automatically determine the new version and release to npm. In a nutshell:

   ##### Commit Message Conventions

   - Commit test files with `test: ...` or `test(scope): ...` prefix
   - Commit bug fixes with `fix: ...` or `fix(scope): ...` prefix
   - Commit new features with `feat: ...` or `feat(scope): ...` prefix
   - Commit breaking changes by adding `BREAKING CHANGE: ` in the commit body
     (not the subject line)
   - Commit changes to `package.json`, `.gitignore` and other meta files with
     `chore(filenamewithoutext): ...`
   - Commit changes to README files or comments with `docs: ...`
   - Cody style changes with `style: standard`

**IMPORTANT**: Before submitting a patch, improvement, or feature, you must first agree to and sign the Contributor Agreement.
